\usage{
Calendar(holidays = integer(0), start.date = NULL, end.date = NULL,
  name = NULL, weekdays = NULL, adjust.from = adjust.next,
  adjust.to = adjust.previous)

create.calendar(name, holidays = integer(0), weekdays = NULL,
  start.date = NULL, end.date = NULL, adjust.from = adjust.none,
  adjust.to = adjust.none)
}
\arguments{
\item{holidays}{a vector of Dates which contains the holidays}

\item{start.date}{the date which the calendar starts}

\item{end.date}{the date which the calendar ends}

\item{name}{calendar's name. This is used to retrieve calendars from register.}

\item{weekdays}{a character vector which defines the weekdays to be used as
non-working days (defaults to \code{NULL} which represents an actual 
calendar). It accepts: \code{sunday}, \code{monday}, \code{thuesday}, 
\code{wednesday}, \code{thursday}, \code{friday}, \code{saturday}. 
Defining the weekend as nonworking days is \code{weekdays=c("saturday", "sunday")}.}

\item{adjust.from}{is a function to be used with the \code{bizdays}'s \code{from} argument.
That function adjusts the argument if it is a nonworking day according to calendar.}

\item{adjust.to}{is a function to be used with the \code{bizdays}'s \code{to} argument.
See also \code{adjust.from}.}
}
\description{
\code{create.calendar} creates calendars and stores them in the calendar register.
}
\details{
The arguments \code{start.date} and \code{end.date} can be set but once they aren't and \code{holidays}
is set, \code{start.date} is defined to \code{min(holidays)} and \code{end.date} to \code{max(holidays)}.
If holidays isn't set \code{start.date} is set to \code{'1970-01-01'} and \code{end.date} to \code{'2071-01-01'}.

\code{weekdays} is controversial but it is only a sequence of nonworking weekdays.
In the great majority of situations it refers to the weekend but it is also possible defining
it differently.
\code{weekdays} accepts a \code{character} sequence with lower case weekdays (
\code{sunday}, \code{monday}, \code{thuesday}, \code{wednesday}, \code{thursday},
\code{friday}, \code{saturday}).
This argument defaults to \code{NULL} because the default intended behavior for 
\code{create.calendar} returns an \emph{actual} calendar, so calling \code{create.calendar(name="xxx")} 
returns a \emph{actual} calendar named \emph{xxx}.
(for more calendars see \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_count_convention}{Day Count Convention})
To define the weekend as the nonworking weekdays one could simply
use \code{weekdays=c("saturday", "sunday")}.

The arguments \code{adjust.from} and \code{adjust.to} are used to adjust \code{bizdays}' arguments
\code{from} and \code{to}, respectively.
These arguments need to be adjusted when nonworking days are provided.
The default behavior, setting \code{adjust.from=adjust.previous} and \code{adjust.to=adjust.next},
works like Excel's function NETWORKDAYS, since that is fairly used by a great number of practitioners.

\section{Calendars register}{


Every named calendar is stored in a register so that it can be retrieved by 
its name (in \code{calendars}).
bizdays' methods also accept the calendar's name on their \code{cal} argument.
Given that, naming calendars is strongly recommended.
}
\examples{
# ANBIMA's calendar (from Brazil)
cal <- create.calendar("Brazil/ANBIMA", holidays=holidaysANBIMA, weekdays=c("saturday", "sunday"))

# ACTUAL calendar
cal <- create.calendar("Actual")

# named calendars can be accessed by its name
create.calendar(name="Actual")
bizdays('2016-01-01', '2016-03-14', 'Actual')
}
